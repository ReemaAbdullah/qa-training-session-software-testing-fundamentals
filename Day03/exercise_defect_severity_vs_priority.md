## Exercise: Defect Severity vs. Priority 🎯🔢

In this exercise, we will explore the concepts of defect severity and priority and understand their differences using real-life examples. Let's see how emojis can help us grasp these concepts better!

### Defect Severity 🎭

Defect severity refers to the impact of a defect on the system's functionality. It helps determine how critical and severe a defect is. Consider the following emojis as representations of different defect severity levels:

- 😊 Low Severity: Minor issues that have minimal impact on the system's functionality. For example, a button color that doesn't match the design guideline.
- 😐 Medium Severity: Defects that affect some functionality but have manageable workarounds. For instance, a search feature that occasionally returns inaccurate results.
- 😟 High Severity: Defects that significantly impact the system's functionality or usability. An example could be a login process that fails intermittently, preventing users from accessing the system.
- 😱 Critical Severity: Severe defects that cause system crashes, data loss, or security vulnerabilities. Imagine a scenario where a banking application allows unauthorized access to user accounts.

### Defect Priority 🔢

Defect priority defines the order in which defects should be addressed based on business needs and urgency. Let's use the following emojis to represent different defect priority levels:

- ⏳ Low Priority: Defects that can be addressed in later releases or have minimal impact on immediate business needs. For example, a cosmetic defect in a rarely used feature.
- 🌟 Medium Priority: Defects that require attention but do not block critical functionality. Consider a defect that affects a non-essential feature of an application.
- 🚀 High Priority: Defects that affect critical functionality or have a significant impact on business operations. For instance, a defect that prevents users from completing a purchase in an e-commerce application.
- 🚨 Urgent Priority: Defects that require immediate attention and resolution due to their criticality or business impact. Imagine a defect that causes a system outage or compromises data security.

### Real-life Example 🏢

Let's consider a real-life example to put these concepts into perspective. Suppose you are testing a messaging application, and you encounter the following defects:

1. Defect A: Messages occasionally fail to send, affecting the core functionality of the application. This defect has a high severity (😟) as it significantly impacts the usability of the messaging system.
   - Priority: Since it affects the core functionality, it should be assigned a high priority (🚀) to ensure its quick resolution.

2. Defect B: The timestamp of messages is occasionally displayed incorrectly, but it doesn't affect the ability to send or receive messages. This defect has a low severity (😊) as it has minimal impact on the system's functionality.
   - Priority: Since it has minimal impact and is not critical, it can be assigned a low priority (⏳) and addressed in a future release.

By distinguishing between severity and priority, you can effectively communicate the impact and urgency of defects to the development team and prioritize their resolution accordingly.

Now it's your turn! Identify a real-life example where you can differentiate between defect severity and priority, and share it.

Happy learning! 🚀🐞
