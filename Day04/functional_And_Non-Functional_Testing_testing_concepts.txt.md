## Functional Testing :gear:

Functional testing is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying whether a system or software application meets the specified functional requirements. It involves testing the individual functions and features of the system to ensure that they operate correctly and produce the expected results. ✅

### Types of Functional Testing:

1. **Unit Testing**: This type of testing focuses on testing individual units or components of the software in isolation. It aims to validate that each unit functions correctly as per the design specifications. 🔬

2. **Integration Testing**: Integration testing is performed to test the interaction and integration between different modules or components of the software. It ensures that the integrated system functions seamlessly and the modules work together as expected. 🔌

3. **System Testing**: System testing involves testing the entire system as a whole to verify its compliance with the specified requirements. It checks the system's behavior and performance in different scenarios and ensures that all the components work together correctly. 💻

4. **Acceptance Testing**: Acceptance testing is conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria and meets the needs of the end-users or stakeholders. It focuses on validating the system's functionality from the user's perspective. 👍

5. **Regression Testing**: Regression testing is performed to ensure that recent changes or modifications to the software have not introduced new defects or caused any existing functionality to break. It retests the affected areas as well as the related functionalities to verify their stability. 🔁

## Non-Functional Testing :wrench:

Non-functional testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the performance, security, and usability aspects of a system or application. It focuses on the non-functional requirements such as reliability, scalability, efficiency, and user experience. 🔒

### Tools and Techniques for Non-Functional Testing:

1. **Performance Testing**: Performance testing is conducted to assess the responsiveness, speed, and stability of a system under different workloads and conditions. It helps identify performance bottlenecks, measure response times, and optimize system performance. Some commonly used performance testing tools include JMeter, LoadRunner, and Gatling. 📈

2. **Security Testing**: Security testing aims to identify vulnerabilities and potential security risks in a system. It involves assessing the system's ability to protect data, detect unauthorized access, and ensure secure communication. Popular security testing tools include OWASP ZAP, Nessus, and Burp Suite. 🔐

3. **Usability Testing**: Usability testing focuses on evaluating the user-friendliness and user experience of a system. It involves gathering feedback from real users to identify any usability issues, improve user interfaces, and enhance overall user satisfaction. Techniques like user interviews, surveys, and usability testing sessions are commonly employed for this purpose. 🙋

4. **Compatibility Testing**: Compatibility testing verifies that the system or application functions correctly across different platforms, browsers, devices, and operating systems. It ensures that the software is compatible with the intended environment and provides consistent behavior. Tools like BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, and CrossBrowserTesting assist in compatibility testing. 🌐

5. **Scalability Testing**: Scalability testing evaluates a system's ability to handle increasing workloads and user demands. It helps determine the system's performance limits, identify bottlenecks, and plan for future growth. Techniques like load testing, stress testing, and performance testing are often utilized to assess scalability. 🚀

In conclusion, functional testing focuses on verifying the correctness of individual functions and features, while non-functional testing assesses the performance, security, and usability aspects of a system. Both types of testing are essential for ensuring the overall quality and reliability of software applications. 👍
